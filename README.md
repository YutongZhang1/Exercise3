# Exercise3
Code repository for Exercise 3 of NLP class, Master's in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, Pompeu Fabra University. Code created by Yutong Zhang.

*** 
### Exercise goal
The goal of this project is to create a character-based model capable of generating Chinese animal names, drawing inspiration from concepts introduced in Andrej Karpathy’s lecture course[1], focusing on explore how modifying the embedding sizes affects the representation and accuracy of Chinese animal names in the NLP model.

*** 
### Requirements
The code is written in python 3

Packages and libraries required:

torch

torch.nn.functional

matplotlib.pyplot

random

*** 
### Data
The dataset used in this study (animal_names_ch.txt) was sourced from a Chinese website[2] and contained approximately 500 animal names written in Chinese characters.
